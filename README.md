# SmartReader Cloud Backend

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)  
A backend application for managing, monitoring, and interacting with IoT and RFID devices using **NestJS**, **MQTT**, and **MongoDB**. The system enables real-time control, monitoring, and traceability of devices in dynamic IoT environments.

## üåê Features

- **API Key Authentication:** Secure access using API keys with customizable permissions.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Assigns `admin`, `operator`, and `viewer` roles for fine-grained access.
- **Rate Limiting:** Uses `nestjs/throttler` to enforce per-role API rate limits.
- **Device Management:** Register, update, and monitor IoT and RFID devices.
- **MQTT Communication:** Send control and management commands to devices and receive events in real time.
- **Event Tracking:** Stores and processes device-generated events.
- **Metrics & Monitoring:** Tracks system load, uptime, resource usage, and device connectivity.
- **Webhook Integration:** Allows external services to subscribe to real-time device events.
- **Prometheus & Grafana Integration:** Provides real-time system monitoring with a `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus scraping.
- **Swagger API Documentation:** Built-in API documentation for easy exploration and testing.
- **Postman Collection:** [API cURL Examples](api-curl-examples.md) included for easy API testing.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The system follows a modular structure using **NestJS** modules, making it highly maintainable and scalable:

- **ApiKeys Module:** Manages API key creation, validation, and role-based access.
- **Auth Module:** Provides middleware for API key authentication and RBAC enforcement.
- **Throttler Module:** Implements request throttling based on user roles.
- **MQTT Module:** Handles MQTT communication with devices.
- **Events Module:** Stores and processes device-generated events.
- **Commands Module:** Manages control and management commands for IoT devices.
- **Metrics Module:** Provides system performance metrics and device uptime tracking.
- **Monitoring Module:** Monitors device connectivity and offline status.
- **Webhooks Module:** Manages webhook subscriptions and event dispatching.

---

### üê≥ Running with Docker Compose

To start the application along with MongoDB and Mosquitto services:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The application will be available at:  
http://localhost:3000

[API cURL Examples](api-curl-examples.md)

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Development

For development with live reload and debugging enabled:

```bash
pnpm run start:dev
```

To debug using the Node.js inspector:

```bash
pnpm run start:dev:debug
```

### üìö Key Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                         | Description                                    |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |

### üîó Default MQTT Topic Structure

Configure your devices to communicate with the backend using the following MQTT topics:

| Topic                                                    | Purpose                                       | Example Topic                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `smartreader/{deviceSerial}/events`                      | Publish device events to the backend          | `smartreader/ABC123/events`                      |
| `smartreader/{deviceSerial}/command/control`             | Receive control commands from the backend     | `smartreader/ABC123/command/control`             |
| `smartreader/{deviceSerial}/command/control/response`    | Publish command responses back to the backend | `smartreader/ABC123/command/control/response`    |
| `smartreader/{deviceSerial}/command/management`          | Receive management commands from the backend  | `smartreader/ABC123/command/management`          |
| `smartreader/{deviceSerial}/command/management/response` | Publish command responses back to the backend | `smartreader/ABC123/command/management/response` |

### üìä Prometheus & Grafana Integration

- The application exposes system metrics for **Prometheus** at:

  ```
  http://localhost:3000/metrics
  ```

- **Grafana** can be configured to pull data from Prometheus for visualization.

To start monitoring services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d prometheus grafana
```

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Security

- **API Key Authentication**: Protects most endpoints using an API key passed via the `x-api-key` header.
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Restricts API access based on user roles (`admin`, `operator`, `viewer`).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents excessive API usage per key.
- **Webhook Signature Verification**: Ensures secure event dispatching.
